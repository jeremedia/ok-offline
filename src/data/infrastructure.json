      "history": "Since 1986, when Larry Harvey and Jerry James built the first 8-foot tall wooden Man on Baker Beach in San Francisco, The Man has evolved into a towering 105-foot structure that serves as the spiritual and geographic center of Black Rock City. What began as a spontaneous act of radical self-expression among friends has become the focal point for 80,000+ participants.",
      "civicPurpose": "The Man serves multiple civic functions: as the city's primary landmark for navigation, the central gathering space for community events, and the symbolic heart that unites all participants. Its base houses art installations and provides shade during the day, while at night it becomes a beacon visible from everywhere in the city.",
      "legalContext": "The Man is a permitted temporary structure under the Bureau of Land Management's Special Recreation Permit for Burning Man. It must comply with specific height restrictions, structural engineering requirements, and safety protocols. The burn event itself requires coordination with BLM, local fire departments, and adherence to strict perimeter and safety regulations.",
      "operations": "Built by the Department of Public Works (DPW) over several months, The Man requires a team of skilled builders, riggers, electricians, and pyrotechnicians. The structure is designed to burn safely and completely, with extensive planning for crowd control, fire safety perimeters, and emergency response. Post-burn cleanup ensures complete removal of all materials.",

      "history": "The Temple tradition began in 2000 with David Best's 'Temple of the Mind.' Originally created to honor a friend killed in a motorcycle accident, it quickly became a place where participants could grieve and remember. Each year, a new artist creates a unique Temple design, but the purpose remains constant: providing space for mourning, reflection, and release.",
      "civicPurpose": "The Temple serves as Black Rock City's spiritual center, offering a quiet space contrasting with the festival atmosphere. Participants leave photos, letters, and mementos honoring deceased loved ones. The Temple burn on Sunday night is a solemn ceremony of collective mourning and release, one of the most emotionally powerful moments of the event.",
      "legalContext": "Like The Man, the Temple requires BLM permits and must meet structural safety requirements. However, it has additional considerations: maintaining a respectful perimeter, managing the more solemn burn ceremony, and ensuring appropriate crowd control for a contemplative rather than celebratory event.",
      "operations": "Temple construction involves the selected artist team and volunteers who understand the sacred nature of the project.

      "shortDescription": "Over 1,500 portable toilets strategically placed throughout the city, serviced multiple times daily.",
      "history": "Sanitation management has evolved from basic portable toilets to a sophisticated system handling the waste of 80,000 people in a Leave No Trace environment. The infamous 'porto-potties' have become a defining feature of the Burning Man experience, inspiring both dread and creative decoration.",
      "civicPurpose": "Proper sanitation is critical for public health and environmental protection in a city of 80,000. The facility placement, service schedule, and maintenance ensure hygiene standards while protecting the playa's delicate ecosystem from contamination.",
      "legalContext": "Sanitation services must meet Nevada health department standards and BLM environmental requirements. The contract includes strict service schedules, waste disposal protocols, and contingency plans for system failures. Leave No Trace principles are legally binding.",
      "operations": "United Site Services provides over 1,500 units serviced by a fleet of pump trucks making continuous rounds. Units are strategically placed based on population density, with higher concentrations near Center Camp and along main streets. Service runs 24/7 during peak times.",

      "shortDescription": "The pentagon-shaped fence defining Black Rock City's boundaries, with entry points and 24/7 monitoring.",
      "history": "The perimeter fence became necessary as Burning Man grew, both for participant safety and to control access. The pentagon shape was chosen for its symbolic significance and practical benefits. The fence prevents participants from getting lost in the vast playa while defining the event space.",
      "civicPurpose": "The perimeter serves multiple functions: preventing disoriented participants from wandering into the desert, controlling event access, defining the city limits for law enforcement jurisdiction, and catching MOOP (Matter Out Of Place) blown by wind.",
      "legalContext": "The fence is required by BLM permits to define the event boundary and control access. It establishes the permit area's limits and helps ensure only ticketed participants enter. The pentagon points are GPS-surveyed for exact placement each year.",
      "operations": "DPW installs miles of orange safety fence in a pentagon pattern with five points. Perimeter roads allow vehicle patrols. Gate staff control access at entry points. Post-event, crews walk the entire fence line collecting accumulated MOOP.",
