# üó∫Ô∏è Ultimate Burning Man Map Experience - Enhancement Tracking

**Branch:** `feat/ultimate-map-experience`  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Started:** July 28, 2025

## Overview
Transform the OK-OFFLINE map from a functional tool into the premier Burning Man navigation experience, addressing current UX issues and preparing infrastructure for upcoming city routing features.

## Current Issues Identified
- ‚úÖ **Control Panel**: ~~Cluttered interface with poor mobile UX~~ Fixed with tabbed design
- ‚úÖ **State Persistence**: ~~User choices not saved between sessions~~ Fixed with localStorage
- ‚ùå **Deep Linking**: No URL-based map sharing or navigation
- ‚ùå **Mini-Maps**: Limited interaction in detail views
- ‚ùå **Performance**: Marker rendering issues with 750+ items
- ‚ùå **Mobile UX**: Double-scrolling and touch interaction problems

## Phase 1: Core User Experience Improvements ‚ö°

### 1.1 Control Panel Redesign & Consolidation ‚úÖ
- [x] **Modernize control layout** with tabbed interface:
  - **Content Tab**: Camps, Art, Events, Favorites toggles
  - **Layers Tab**: GIS data (Streets, Trash Fence, City Blocks, Plazas)  
  - **Display Tab**: Base Map, City Alignment, Legend, Settings
- [x] **Add persistent state** - save all toggle states to localStorage
- [x] **Improve mobile UX** - replace slide-out panel with bottom sheet design
- [x] **Desktop optimization** - make legend draggable/collapsible with resize handle
- [x] **Reset View button** - return to default zoom/center/rotation
- [x] **Map Info inspector** - live stats showing zoom, bounds, markers, performance

### 1.2 Deep Linking & URL State Management
- [ ] **Implement URL parameters** for map state:
  - `?focus=camp_uid` - center on specific item
  - `?layers=camps,art,streets` - set visible layers
  - `?zoom=15&lat=40.786&lng=-119.203` - map viewport
  - `?year=2025&favorites=true` - data filters
- [ ] **Browser back/forward support** for map navigation
- [ ] **Shareable map links** for social sharing and planning

### 1.3 Enhanced Mini-Maps in Detail Views
- [ ] **Enable limited interaction** - zoom and pan within bounds
- [ ] **Add "Show Route" button** (prep for Phase 2 routing)
- [ ] **Improve visual styling** with better street/landmark display
- [ ] **Add satellite imagery toggle** for 2025 locations
- [ ] **Context awareness** - show nearby camps/art/events

## Phase 2: Advanced Map Features üöÄ

### 2.1 Location State Integration Audit
- [ ] **Verify global location state** integration across all map components
- [ ] **Add visual indicators** when locations are hidden (policy messages)
- [ ] **Implement graceful degradation** - show city outline when locations unavailable
- [ ] **Add debug mode** for location policy testing

### 2.2 Smart Map Intelligence
- [ ] **Adaptive zoom levels** based on content density
- [ ] **Intelligent marker clustering** for crowded areas
- [ ] **Context-aware popups** with expanded information
- [ ] **Quick action buttons** in popups (Favorite, Add to Schedule, Get Directions)

### 2.3 Performance & Mobile Optimization
- [ ] **Implement marker virtualization** for better performance with 750+ items
- [ ] **Add progressive loading** - load markers as user pans/zooms
- [ ] **Optimize touch interactions** with better gesture handling
- [ ] **Improve rotation UI** with snap-to-cardinal-directions

## Phase 3: Routing Foundation (Prep for City Navigation) üõ£Ô∏è

### 3.1 Routing Infrastructure
- [ ] **Add routing service layer** with pathfinding algorithms
- [ ] **Implement route visualization** with Leaflet polylines
- [ ] **Create route profile system** (walking speed, bike speed, accessibility)
- [ ] **Add waypoint management** for multi-stop journeys

### 3.2 Enhanced GIS Integration
- [ ] **Pedestrian path detection** using city block and street data
- [ ] **Bike-friendly route calculation** avoiding heavy traffic areas
- [ ] **Accessibility routing** for mobility-impaired participants
- [ ] **Real-time distance/time estimates** based on route type

### 3.3 Navigation UI Preparation
- [ ] **Add route planning panel** with origin/destination inputs
- [ ] **Implement turn-by-turn UI** (hidden until routing feature launches)
- [ ] **Create location search/autocomplete** for address input
- [ ] **Add journey planning tools** (save multiple routes, favorites)

## Phase 4: Polish & Professional Features ‚ú®

### 4.1 Visual Excellence
- [ ] **Implement comprehensive theming** with consistent color schemes
- [ ] **Add smooth map animations** for transitions and focus changes
- [ ] **Create custom marker designs** that scale well at all zoom levels
- [ ] **Add loading states** and error handling for all map operations

### 4.2 Advanced User Features
- [ ] **Personal map annotations** - let users add private notes to locations
- [ ] **Custom map layers** - user-created collections (e.g., "Must Visit Art")
- [ ] **Offline map caching** - download map tiles for offline use
- [ ] **Screenshot/sharing tools** - capture map views for social media

### 4.3 Developer & Debug Tools
- [ ] **Add comprehensive logging** for map operations
- [ ] **Create map performance monitoring** - FPS, memory usage, render times
- [ ] **Implement A/B testing framework** for UI improvements
- [ ] **Add accessibility audit tools** for WCAG compliance
