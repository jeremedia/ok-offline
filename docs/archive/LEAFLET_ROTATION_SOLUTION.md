# Leaflet Map Rotation: Current Issue & Solutions

## The Problem
When using CSS `transform: rotate()` on Leaflet maps, drag interactions become unreliable because:
- Leaflet calculates mouse positions based on the original coordinate system
- CSS rotation visually rotates the map but doesn't update Leaflet's interaction coordinates
- Dragging, zooming, and touch gestures behave incorrectly

## Current Quick Fix (Implemented)
**Status: ‚úÖ ACTIVE**

We've implemented a pragmatic solution that:
- Disables map interactions when rotation angle > 1¬∞
- Shows a warning message: "‚ö†Ô∏è Interactions disabled while rotated"
- Re-enables interactions when rotation is disabled or minimal
- Maintains visual rotation for navigation/orientation purposes

### User Experience:
- ‚úÖ Perfect city alignment with -45¬∞ rotation
- ‚úÖ Clear visual feedback about interaction status
- ‚ùå No dragging/zooming when rotated (intentional limitation)
- ‚úÖ Smooth toggle between rotated/interactive modes

## Proper Solution: leaflet-rotate Plugin
**Status: üîÑ RECOMMENDED FOR FUTURE**

### Installation:
```bash
npm install leaflet-rotate
```

### Implementation:
```javascript
import L from 'leaflet'
import 'leaflet-rotate'

// Enable rotation in map options
const map = L.map('map', {
  rotate: true,
  rotateControl: {
    closeOnZeroBearing: false
  }
})

// Rotate the map programmatically
map.setBearing(-45) // -45¬∞ for BRC alignment
```

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ Maintains full interaction functionality while rotated
- ‚úÖ Proper coordinate transformation handling
- ‚úÖ Native-feeling drag/zoom/touch gestures
- ‚úÖ Built-in rotation controls

### Considerations:
- Requires additional dependency (~15KB)
- Overrides Leaflet core functionality
- May have compatibility issues with other plugins
- Requires refactoring existing rotation implementation

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### 1. Manual Coordinate Transformation
- Transform mouse coordinates before passing to Leaflet
- Complex mathematical implementation
- High risk of edge cases and bugs

### 2. Different Mapping Library
- MapboxGL JS: Native rotation support
- OpenLayers: Built-in rotation capabilities
- Requires complete mapping rewrite

### 3. Rotation at Data Layer
- Rotate GeoJSON coordinates instead of map
- Maintains interactions but complex data transformation
- Would require regenerating all coordinate data

## Recommendation

**Current State (v1.3.0)**: Keep the interaction-disabling solution
- Simple, reliable, and transparent to users
- Perfect for the primary use case (visual city alignment)
- No additional dependencies or compatibility risks

**Future Enhancement (v1.4.0+)**: Evaluate leaflet-rotate plugin
- Consider when user feedback indicates need for interactive rotation
- Test thoroughly with existing GIS layers and controls
- Implement as optional enhancement rather than replacement

## Implementation Notes

The current solution prioritizes:
1. **Stability**: No risk of broken interactions
2. **Transparency**: Clear user feedback about limitations
3. **Functionality**: Perfect visual alignment for navigation
4. **Simplicity**: Minimal code complexity

For Black Rock City navigation, the visual alignment is more important than interactive dragging when rotated, making our current approach optimal for the use case.
