# Search UI Polish and HDR Color Improvements

## Summary
Enhanced the search interface with improved mobile UX, dynamic placeholders, and color adjustments for HDR screens.

## Changes Made

### 1. Infrastructure Search Type
- Added Infrastructure as a searchable type alongside Camps, Art, Events, and Notes
- Integrated with existing search functionality

### 2. Search Everything Filter
- Added "Search Everything" button as the first filter option
- Implements smart toggle behavior:
  - When all filters selected: clicking deselects all
  - When some unselected: clicking selects all
  - When everything is selected and user clicks individual filter: deselects all others

### 3. Filter Persistence
- Filter preferences now saved to localStorage
- Automatically restored on page load

### 4. Enhanced Results Display
- Shows total items searched alongside results count
- Example: "432 results found from 3,567 items"

### 5. Auto-submit Improvements
- Search auto-submits when loaded with query parameter
- Re-runs search when changing between Keyword/Semantic/Smart modes

### 6. Mobile UI Enhancements

### 7. Layout Improvements
- Moved filter bar to top of search page
- Removed redundant "Search Everything" header

  - "Search camps..." for single filter
  - "Search camps and art..." for two filters
  - "Search camps, art, and events..." for 3+ filters
  - "Select a filter to search..." when none selected

### 9. Visual Enhancements
- Added subtle inner shadow to search inputs
- Auto-focus search field on page load (desktop only due to iOS restrictions)
